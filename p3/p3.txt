	P3 - File Systems

Synopsis
	Implement a userspace filesystem daemon using the FUSE API to
	access data in WAD format.

Description
	The Wad Class implements 7 functions. POSIX calls were needed
	in order to read and get contents of a file such as size and
	the actual contents of the file. The best approach to make the
	Wad file system was using a hash map. The key for mapping
	elements was the descriptor first 4 elements of the ASCII name.
	The loadWad function would create a Wad object which is delcared
	in the Wad.h and organizes the entire file system structure. The
	other functions would then use that object to manipulate the
	contents of that file system at any given time efficiently.
	Getting the magic number required using an unsigned integer
	and converting the file into binary to discover the first four
	bytes of the file (in little Endian).
	
	My daemon (wadfs) also used POSIX calls to access file data
	such as the .WAD files that need to be tested on and retreive
	a target file by using the directory. We use FUSE to navigate
	the contents of the file system of a given .WAD file passed down.

TESTING

	1) Passed down a file name and returned the correct output
	2) Passed down a dirctory and returned the correct output
	3) Tested maker element with format "E#M#"
	4) Tested maker element with format "_START"
	5) Used FUSE to test out every given .WAD file

BUGS
	No bugs found.
