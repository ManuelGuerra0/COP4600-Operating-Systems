P0 Report (Manuel Guerra) 

NAME 
grep – searches files with a specific pattern. 
nano – pulls up built in text editor. 
SYNOPSIS 
Used grep and nano commands to alter messages in the grub menu and debug mode of the operating system. 
DESCRIPTION 
To modify the boot message, we must be in the /usr/rep/src/reptilian-kernel directory to grep -rn the clue given in P0 “rcu_end_inkernel_boot()” which produced the result: /init/main.c which means we change directory to /init and use the nano command to edit the file. I added a printk() with my message inside right after the rcu_end_inkernel_boot() function and saved the edit. 
Additionally, to modify the GRUB menu we had to first go to the /mnt/sysroot/ directory to grep -rn the clue given in P0 “Reptilian 19.01-A8.1” which produced the result: /grub/menu.lst which means we change directory to /grub and the sudo nano command (to gain administrative permission) to edit the file. I simply added my name after the phrase “Reptilian 19.01-A8.1” and saved the edit. After editing everything, I compiled the kernel with a sequence of commands in this order: make, sudo make install, sudo make modules_install. I then restarted the VM to see if my results were successful and it worked. 
Lastly for testing purposes, I created the patch file p0.diff, transferred it to my local host using sftp, then I created a clean VM and used sftp to transfer the p0.diff to remote host, executed “git apply p0.diff” and compiled the kernel using “make && sudo make install && sudo make modules_install”, and the compilation yields the desired result. 
OPTIONS 
-rn – used with the grep command to recursively search for results and output which line the result is found within a file.
